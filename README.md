## ThirdWeb Airdrop Splitter

ThirdWeb Airdrop Splitter since the dashboard only let's you airdrop to 250 addresses at a time. This will create separate csv files to airdrop separately so you can airdrop them easier. This script is designed for 1000 tokens per wallet but you can customize it or create your own algorithms. This python script was created to be able to automatically create multiple csv files. You may wish to add your own algorith, tokenomics, etc. 

## How to 

Make sure to simply fill addresses.csv without any extra information. After running the script, you will see multiple csv files for your airdrop.

addresses.csv can be as big as you want, but make sure the addresses have no added info. Each address should be in a separate line. T
